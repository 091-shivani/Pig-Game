# Pig-Game
It is a 2-Player game in which players roll a single dice as many times they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing gained score for the turn they roll a 1. We can also hold the running total before getting 1 and the other player turn will start. If the score is above a threshold value, we declare the player to be winner.
